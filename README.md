# Proof of Life — 2026

This repository is not a project.
It is an evidence.

Every folder, every file, every commit
represents one real day of my life in 2026.

## Rules
- One day = one file
- One day = one commit
- No fake productivity
- Good days and bad days both count

## Structure
Each file contains:
- Date and exact time
- What I did
- What I felt
- One honest sentence

Nothing here is optimized.
Nothing here is impressive on purpose.

It only exists so that 2026 cannot disappear.


If you’re reading this in the future:
Just so you know, I showed up.
Even on days I didn’t want to.
